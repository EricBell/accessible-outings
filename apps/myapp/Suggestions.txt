This file maintains new feature ideas and optimizations.

  Suggested Feature: AccessibleRouteOptimizer

  Purpose: Help users plan efficient routes visiting multiple wheelchair-accessible venues, considering real accessibility constraints like parking availability
  and terrain difficulty.

  Key Methods:
  def optimize_venue_route(self, start_zip: str, venue_list: List[str], max_radius: int = 30) -> Dict
  def calculate_accessibility_travel_time(self, from_coords: Tuple, to_coords: Tuple) -> float
  def find_accessible_parking_nearby(self, venue_coords: Tuple, radius: float = 0.5) -> List[Dict]

  Why This Feature:
  1. Highly Testable - Pure algorithmic functions with clear inputs/outputs
  2. Real User Value - Solves the complex problem of planning accessible day trips
  3. Leverages Existing Code - Uses current distance calculations and geocoding
  4. Data-Driven - Can incorporate venue accessibility ratings from your review system

  Test Scenarios:
  - Route optimization with different venue combinations
  - Edge cases (unreachable venues, single venue)
  - Performance with large venue lists
  - Accessibility constraint validation

  This feature would integrate seamlessly with your existing calculate_distance() and venue search functionality while providing substantial new value for users
  planning accessible outings.

  > This app is incomplete and I'm going to have other llms try to finish it. what can I ask them to do to move this app forward, but will likely stump them? I need 
  to challenge the llm and get so-so results. My work will start with one or more unit tests that I put in place that fail and the object is to ask the llm to add 
  a feature or fix a problem and try to get the unit test(s) to pass but I don't care if this happens. I want the LLM to have a hard time and possibly fail. what 
  can you come up with?

‚óè Here are some challenging tasks that would likely stump other LLMs, with failing unit tests to guide them:

  Challenge 1: Complex Accessibility Scoring Algorithm üî•

  Create a unit test that expects a sophisticated accessibility scoring system:

  def test_venue_accessibility_composite_score(self):
      """Test complex accessibility scoring with weighted features and user preferences."""
      venue = Venue(name="Test Venue", wheelchair_accessible=True,
                   accessible_parking=True, accessible_restroom=False,
                   hearing_loop=True, braille_menu=False)

      user_needs = {
          'mobility_impaired': True,
          'hearing_impaired': False,
          'vision_impaired': True,
          'cognitive_needs': True
      }

      # Expected: Complex algorithm considering user needs, feature weights, 
      # venue category, time of day, weather conditions
      score = venue.calculate_accessibility_score(user_needs,
                                                 category_weight=0.8,
                                                 time_context="evening",
                                                 weather="rainy")

      self.assertBetween(score, 0.65, 0.75)  # Very specific expected range
      self.assertIn('mobility_friendly', venue.get_accessibility_tags())

  Why it's hard: Requires understanding weighted algorithms, user context, and complex business logic.

  Challenge 2: Geospatial Accessibility Route Optimization üó∫Ô∏è

  def test_accessible_route_multi_venue_optimization(self):
      """Test accessibility-aware route planning across multiple venues."""
      venues = [create_venue("Museum", 42.3601, -71.0589),
                create_venue("Restaurant", 42.3581, -71.0636),
                create_venue("Shop", 42.3555, -71.0675)]

      user_constraints = {
          'max_walking_distance': 0.2,  # miles
          'requires_accessible_parking': True,
          'mobility_device': 'wheelchair',
          'max_total_time': 240  # minutes
      }

      route = RouteOptimizer.plan_accessible_route(
          start_location=(42.3601, -71.0589),
          venues=venues,
          user_constraints=user_constraints,
          optimize_for='accessibility_score'
      )

      self.assertEqual(len(route.venues), 3)
      self.assertTrue(route.is_accessibility_compliant())
      self.assertLess(route.total_walking_distance, 0.6)

  Why it's hard: Combines geospatial algorithms, constraint optimization, and accessibility domain knowledge.

  Challenge 3: Real-time Accessibility Data Synchronization ‚ö°

  def test_accessibility_data_conflict_resolution(self):
      """Test handling of conflicting accessibility reports from multiple sources."""
      venue = Venue(name="Conflicted Venue")

      # Simulate conflicting reports
      reports = [
          AccessibilityReport(source='google_places', wheelchair_accessible=True, confidence=0.7),
          AccessibilityReport(source='user_report', wheelchair_accessible=False, confidence=0.9, timestamp=datetime.now()),
          AccessibilityReport(source='yelp', wheelchair_accessible=True, confidence=0.6),
          AccessibilityReport(source='official_inspection', wheelchair_accessible=False, confidence=0.95, timestamp=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30))
      ]

      resolver = AccessibilityDataResolver()
      final_status = resolver.resolve_conflicts(venue, reports)

      # Should weigh recency, source credibility, and confidence
      self.assertFalse(final_status.wheelchair_accessible)
      self.assertEqual(final_status.confidence_level, 'high')
      self.assertEqual(final_status.primary_source, 'user_report')

  Why it's hard: Requires understanding data fusion, conflict resolution algorithms, and temporal reasoning.

  Challenge 4: Natural Language Accessibility Extraction üß†

  def test_extract_accessibility_from_reviews(self):
      """Test NLP extraction of accessibility features from unstructured reviews."""
      reviews = [
          "The ramp was really steep and hard to navigate with my wheelchair",
          "Great place! Easy parking right by the entrance, very accessible",
          "Beautiful museum but the elevator was broken when we visited",
          "Staff was helpful moving tables for my mobility scooter"
      ]

      extractor = AccessibilityNLPExtractor()
      features = extractor.extract_features(reviews)

      expected_features = {
          'wheelchair_accessible': {'positive': 1, 'negative': 1, 'neutral': 0},
          'accessible_parking': {'positive': 1, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 0},
          'elevator_access': {'positive': 0, 'negative': 1, 'neutral': 0},
          'staff_assistance': {'positive': 1, 'negative': 0, 'neutral': 0}
      }

      self.assertEqual(features.sentiment_scores, expected_features)
      self.assertIn('steep_ramp_concern', features.extracted_issues)

  Why it's hard: Requires NLP knowledge, sentiment analysis, and domain-specific feature extraction.

  Challenge 5: Dynamic Accessibility Heatmap Generation üìä

  def test_generate_accessibility_heatmap_data(self):
      """Test generation of accessibility density heatmap for geographic regions."""
      venues = create_test_venues_grid(lat_range=(42.35, 42.37),
                                     lon_range=(-71.08, -71.05),
                                     count=50)

      heatmap_generator = AccessibilityHeatmapGenerator()
      heatmap_data = heatmap_generator.generate_heatmap(
          venues=venues,
          grid_resolution=0.001,  # Very fine resolution
          accessibility_weights={
              'wheelchair_accessible': 0.4,
              'accessible_parking': 0.3,
              'accessible_restroom': 0.2,
              'hearing_loop': 0.1
          },
          demographic_data=load_census_data()  # Population density weighting
      )

      self.assertEqual(len(heatmap_data.grid_points), 400)  # 20x20 grid
      self.assertTrue(all(0 <= point.accessibility_score <= 1
                         for point in heatmap_data.grid_points))
      self.assertIsInstance(heatmap_data.hotspots, list)
      self.assertGreater(len(heatmap_data.accessibility_deserts), 0)

  Why it's hard: Requires geographic data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization data structures.

  Challenge 6: Accessibility Compliance Legal Validation ‚öñÔ∏è

  def test_ada_compliance_validation(self):
      """Test ADA compliance checking with legal requirement validation."""
      venue = Venue(name="Legal Test Venue",
                   built_year=1995,  # Post-ADA
                   square_footage=5000,
                   business_type="restaurant",
                   employee_count=25)

      compliance_checker = ADAComplianceChecker()
      report = compliance_checker.validate_compliance(venue)

      expected_requirements = [
          'accessible_entrance_width_32_inches',
          'accessible_parking_ratio_1_per_25',
          'accessible_restroom_required',
          'door_opening_force_max_5_pounds',
          'counter_height_max_36_inches'
      ]

      self.assertEqual(report.applicable_requirements, expected_requirements)
      self.assertIn('non_compliant', report.status)
      self.assertGreater(len(report.violations), 0)
      self.assertIsInstance(report.estimated_retrofit_cost, float)

  Why it's hard: Requires legal domain knowledge, complex rule engines, and business logic.

  The Ultimate Challenge: Multi-Modal Accessibility Prediction ü§ñ

  Create this as your final test:

  def test_predictive_accessibility_model(self):
      """Test ML model predicting accessibility based on venue characteristics."""
      # This requires training data, feature engineering, and ML pipeline
      venue_features = {
          'building_age': 15,
          'business_type': 'restaurant',
          'chain_brand': 'local',
          'neighborhood_walkability_score': 78,
          'nearby_accessible_venues_count': 12,
          'google_street_view_features': ['ramp_visible', 'wide_entrance'],
          'review_accessibility_mentions': 23
      }

      predictor = AccessibilityPredictor()
      prediction = predictor.predict_accessibility_features(venue_features)

      # Expected: ML model predicting multiple accessibility features
      self.assertIsInstance(prediction.wheelchair_accessible_probability, float)
      self.assertBetween(prediction.confidence_interval[0], 0.65, 0.85)
      self.assertIn('high_confidence', prediction.prediction_quality)

  Instructions to Give the LLM

  "I have an accessibility outings app with failing unit tests. The tests expect sophisticated accessibility algorithms and features that don't exist yet. Your 
  task is to implement the missing functionality to make these tests pass. The code should be production-ready with proper error handling, performance 
  optimization, and extensibility. Focus on the failing test: test_venue_accessibility_composite_score first."

  Why these will stump LLMs:
  1. Domain expertise required (accessibility law, algorithms)
  2. Multiple complex systems integration needed
  3. Performance optimization under constraints
  4. Real-world data handling complexities
  5. ML/AI components requiring training data
  6. Geospatial algorithms and optimization
  7. Legal compliance knowledge needed

  Pick any of these - they should provide a good challenge while potentially yielding interesting partial implementations!

> Let's go with the ultimate challenge. create some unit tests for me that should fail now that have to pass with the LLMs work. Put the tests in a file call 
  ultimate_tests.py

‚óè Perfect! I've created ultimate_tests.py with 10 comprehensive test cases that will definitely challenge any LLM. Here's what makes these tests particularly
  difficult:

  What Makes This Challenge Brutal üî•

  1. Multi-Domain Expertise Required

  - Machine Learning: Model training, ensemble methods, feature engineering
  - Computer Vision: Street view image analysis, object detection
  - Geospatial Analysis: Geographic context, proximity calculations
  - Domain Knowledge: ADA compliance, accessibility standards

  2. Complex Dependencies

  - External APIs (Google Street View, census data)
  - ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch implied)
  - Image processing libraries (OpenCV, PIL)
  - Geospatial libraries (Shapely, Geopandas)

  3. Performance Requirements

  - Sub-2 second prediction times
  - Batch processing optimization
  - Caching mechanisms
  - Real-time constraints

  4. Sophisticated Architecture Needs

  AccessibilityPredictor
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FeatureExtractor
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StreetViewAnalyzer (Computer Vision)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GeospatialAccessibilityAnalyzer
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EnsemblePredictor
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ModelValidator
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PredictionCache

  5. Advanced ML Concepts

  - Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
  - Feature importance analysis (SHAP/LIME)
  - Model calibration and ensemble aggregation
  - Online learning and model updates

  Instructions to Give the LLM üìã

  "I have an accessibility prediction system with failing unit tests in ultimate_tests.py. The system needs to predict venue accessibility using machine learning, 
  computer vision analysis of street view images, and geospatial context. All tests currently fail because the implementation doesn't exist.

  Your task: Create the missing classes and methods to make these tests pass. Focus on:
  1. utils/accessibility_predictor.py - Main prediction engine
  2. ML models that can predict accessibility from venue features3. Computer vision analysis of Google Street View images
  4. Performance optimization (sub-2 second predictions)
  5. API endpoints for real-time predictions

  The tests expect production-ready code with proper error handling, caching, and performance optimization. Start with the basic AccessibilityPredictor class and 
  work your way up to the ensemble methods."

  Why This Will Stump Most LLMs üß†

  1. No Clear Starting Point: Multiple interconnected systems needed
  2. Real ML Implementation: Needs actual trained models, not just stubs
  3. Computer Vision: Street view analysis requires CV expertise
  4. Performance Constraints: Must be production-ready, not just functional
  5. Domain Complexity: Accessibility is a specialized field
  6. Integration Challenges: Must work with existing Flask app architecture

  Expected Outcomes üìä

  - Novice LLMs: Will create basic stubs, fail on ML implementation
  - Intermediate LLMs: Might implement basic prediction logic, struggle with CV/geospatial
  - Advanced LLMs: Could create sophisticated solutions but likely miss performance/caching requirements
  - Expert LLMs: Might succeed but will be thoroughly challenged

  Run the Challenge üöÄ

  # See all the failing tests
  python -m unittest ultimate_tests -v

  # Run specific challenging test
  python ultimate_tests.py

  This should provide an excellent test of an LLM's ability to handle complex, multi-domain software engineering challenges! The tests are comprehensive enough
  that even partial implementations would be valuable contributions to the codebase.

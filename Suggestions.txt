  Suggested Feature: AccessibleRouteOptimizer

  Purpose: Help users plan efficient routes visiting multiple wheelchair-accessible venues, considering real accessibility constraints like parking availability
  and terrain difficulty.

  Key Methods:
  def optimize_venue_route(self, start_zip: str, venue_list: List[str], max_radius: int = 30) -> Dict
  def calculate_accessibility_travel_time(self, from_coords: Tuple, to_coords: Tuple) -> float
  def find_accessible_parking_nearby(self, venue_coords: Tuple, radius: float = 0.5) -> List[Dict]

  Why This Feature:
  1. Highly Testable - Pure algorithmic functions with clear inputs/outputs
  2. Real User Value - Solves the complex problem of planning accessible day trips
  3. Leverages Existing Code - Uses current distance calculations and geocoding
  4. Data-Driven - Can incorporate venue accessibility ratings from your review system

  Test Scenarios:
  - Route optimization with different venue combinations
  - Edge cases (unreachable venues, single venue)
  - Performance with large venue lists
  - Accessibility constraint validation

  This feature would integrate seamlessly with your existing calculate_distance() and venue search functionality while providing substantial new value for users
  planning accessible outings.
